“Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. 
Double your rate of failure. You’re thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all, 
you can be discouraged by failure – or you can learn from it. So go ahead and make mistakes. 
Make all you can. Because remember that’s where you’ll find success. On the far side of failure.” Thomas J. Watson, Past CEO of IBM
